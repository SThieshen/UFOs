# UFOs

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a dynamic webpage that accepts user input and adjusts accordingly to display information about UFO sightings. In order to perform analysis, users filter the UFO sightings table based on multiple criteria such as the event date, city, state, country and shape. 

## Results

### Search Criteria Procedure

The webpage can be accessed at the following link: https://sthieshen.github.io./


#### Index page
This is the initial page. The user can re-initialize the page by clicking on the navigation bar at the top.

#### Filtering by event date
The user enters the desired date, the change is detected, and the table is updated accordingly.

#### Filtering by city
The user enters the desired city, the change is detected, and the table is updated accordingly.

Users can also filter by country and/or shape of sighting, and all filter parameters can be entered simultaneously or each field separately.

## Summary

One disadvantage of this design for users is that the user would have difficulty knowing what parameter to use for the filtering. For example, to pick a city, the user would have to go through the table and find the city desired for the analysis. This could be addressed by drop-down lists, including all filter values in place of the input fields. Each list would need to update after a parameter is selected in any filter. Another way to improve the design of this webpage would be to include a button to clear the filters as needed. The button would be located below the last filter in which the user could click to clear searches.
